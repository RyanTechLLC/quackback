 * against `node_modules/.bun/better-auth@1.6.5/.../two-factor/index.mjs`
 * line ~256, which returns only `twoFactorRedirect` + `twoFactorMethods`).
 * Likewise the client-side `onTwoFactorRedirect` hook only sees
 * `{ twoFactorMethods }` (see `client.d.mts` in the same package). The
 * original request body is invisible to both.
 *
 * So login forms stash the desired post-auth destination here before
 * calling `signIn.email`. The twoFactorClient redirect handler reads it
 * and forwards as `?callbackURL=` on the `/auth/two-factor` URL; the
 * route then consumes that param (with a `/`-prefix safety check) on
 * successful verification and clears the key.

/**
 * Sign out the current user.
 *
 * Layered approach (both fire, the order matters):
 *  1. Mark silent SSO as suppressed in **sessionStorage** so the
 *     in-flight `useSilentSso` hook in this tab can't race against
 *     the signout navigation. Tab-scoped on purpose — cross-tab +
 *     cross-restart protection comes from step (3) actually
 *     destroying the IdP session, so a `prompt=none` retry in
 *     another tab returns `login_required` cleanly. Making this
 *     flag durable was a previous attempt at defense-in-depth that
 *     turned out to permanently block silent SSO for anyone who
 *     ever signed out — see `use-silent-sso.ts` for the legacy
 *     localStorage flag cleanup.
 *  2. Clear the Better-Auth session cookie via `authClient.signOut`.
 *  3. If the workspace has SSO configured AND the IdP advertises an
 *     `end_session_endpoint` in its discovery doc, top-window-
 *     navigate to it with `client_id` + `post_logout_redirect_uri`
 *     set. The IdP destroys its session and bounces back to
 *     `/auth/sso-logout-complete`, which forwards to `/auth/login`.
 *     This is the spec'd RP-Initiated Logout flow — the only way
 *     to actually end the cross-app SSO session.
 *
 * If RP-initiated logout fails (no SSO configured, discovery fetch
 * fails, IdP doesn't publish `end_session_endpoint`), we fall back
 * to a Quackback-only signout. In that degraded mode silent SSO
 * WILL pick the user up again on the next page load via the
 * still-alive IdP session — which is correct behavior for a Quack-
 * back-only logout: the IdP session is the cross-app source of
 * truth, and a local-only signout shouldn't trump it.
 *
 * Note: callers that need to invalidate the router AFTER local
 * signout (admin sidebar, etc.) should still call
 * `router.invalidate()` themselves. When RP-initiated logout is
 * available we navigate away before that runs, which is fine —
 * the post-logout landing page is fresh-loaded.
