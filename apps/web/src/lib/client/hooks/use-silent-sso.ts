/**
 * Silent SSO bootstrap — attempts a zero-click OIDC sign-in via a
 * hidden iframe with `prompt=none`.
 *
 * Why this exists: users coming from a sister app that shares the
 * same IdP (e.g. InterpriseOne) already have a Better-Auth session
 * on the IdP's domain. The OIDC spec's `prompt=none` flow lets us
 * complete the authorization-code dance without ever rendering a
 * login page — the IdP either returns a code immediately (session
 * present) or returns `error=login_required` (session missing).
 *
 * Mechanics:
 *  1. Ask Better-Auth for the IdP authorize URL via the same
 *     `signIn.oauth2` call the popup button uses, with
 *     `disableRedirect: true` so we get the URL back instead of a
 *     top-window navigation. Better-Auth still seeds the state
 *     cookies needed for callback validation.
 *  2. Force `prompt=none` into the authorize URL's query.
 *  3. Mount a hidden iframe pointing at that URL.
 *  4. On success the iframe lands on `/auth/auth-complete`, which
 *     posts to the `quackback-auth` BroadcastChannel; our listener
 *     reloads the page so route loaders pick up the new session.
 *  5. On failure (no IdP session, blocked by CSP, etc.) the iframe
 *     ends up on a same-origin URL that is NOT
 *     `/auth/auth-complete` — typically `/api/auth/error` or the
 *     login page. We detect that via the iframe's `onload` event
 *     and silently remove the iframe; the host page renders as
 *     normal.
 *
 * Loop / UX guards:
 *  - `quackback.sso.attempted` (sessionStorage): set once an attempt
 *    is mounted, cleared only after the post-success reload has
 *    actually produced a signed-in session (verified by route
 *    context). Prevents a reload-loop when the cookie was set but
 *    the route loader refuses to recognise the session for some
 *    other reason.
 *  - `quackback.sso.suppressed` (sessionStorage): set by the signout
 *    flow for in-tab protection against the brief race between
 *    "user clicked sign out" and "RP-initiated logout completes" —
 *    we don't want this tab to silently re-auth in the half-second
 *    window before the redirect to the IdP endsession endpoint
 *    fires. Cross-tab + cross-restart protection comes from
 *    RP-initiated logout itself, which destroys the IdP session
 *    so a fresh `prompt=none` returns `login_required` cleanly.
 *    Keeping this flag tab-scoped means closing and reopening a
 *    tab a day later auto-signs in normally (the IdP is the
 *    source of truth for "am I signed in here").
