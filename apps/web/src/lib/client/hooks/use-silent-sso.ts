/**
 * Silent SSO bootstrap — attempts a zero-click OIDC sign-in via a
 * hidden iframe with `prompt=none`.
 *
 * Why this exists: users coming from a sister app that shares the
 * same IdP (e.g. InterpriseOne) already have a Better-Auth session
 * on the IdP's domain. The OIDC spec's `prompt=none` flow lets us
 * complete the authorization-code dance without ever rendering a
 * login page — the IdP either returns a code immediately (session
 * present) or returns `error=login_required` (session missing).
 *
 * Mechanics:
 *  1. Ask Better-Auth for the IdP authorize URL via the same
 *     `signIn.oauth2` call the popup button uses, with
 *     `disableRedirect: true` so we get the URL back instead of a
 *     top-window navigation. Better-Auth still seeds the state
 *     cookies needed for callback validation.
 *  2. Force `prompt=none` into the authorize URL's query.
 *  3. Mount a hidden iframe pointing at that URL.
 *  4. On success the iframe lands on `/auth/auth-complete`, which
 *     posts to the `quackback-auth` BroadcastChannel; our listener
 *     reloads the page so route loaders pick up the new session.
 *  5. On failure (no IdP session, blocked by CSP, etc.) the iframe
 *     ends up on a same-origin URL that is NOT
 *     `/auth/auth-complete` — typically `/api/auth/error` or the
 *     login page. We detect that via the iframe's `onload` event
 *     and silently remove the iframe; the host page renders as
 *     normal.
 *
 * Loop / UX guards:
 *  - `quackback.sso.attempted` (sessionStorage): set once an attempt
 *    is mounted, cleared on successful sign-in. Prevents an infinite
 *    re-attempt loop if the IdP is mis-configured or the user closes
 *    the IdP session mid-flow.
 *  - `quackback.sso.suppressed` (sessionStorage): set by the signout
 *    flow so a user who explicitly signed out doesn't get yanked
 *    straight back in. Cleared on the next sessionStorage scope
 *    boundary (tab close) or when they explicitly start an SSO sign-in.
